## Writing a C Program
1. Create the source code.
2. Compile the source code into object code.
3. Link the object code with library to create a program.
4. Test, Debug, Rewrite, and so on.

## The Linker and Libraries
- The Linker mixes object code with a library.
- Library contains object code for specific functions.
- The program is built to run on a specific platform.

## Standard C Library
- Default library is used for basic C language programs.
- Contains instructions for common C language functions.
- Math functions may be found in a separate math library.

## Library File Naming Convention 
libname.a
- File name begins with lib followed by the library name.
- File name extension is .a for a static library, .dylib for dynamic library, plus others.
- When linking the library, use only library's name.
